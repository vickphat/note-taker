## Description:
For this project, I was task of creating a note taker. I was already given starting code such as the HTML files, JavaScript and CSS files. My main focus was to create the backend and link it together with the front end. When a user visits the deployed application site, it will be the homepage of the note taker. The user will have to click the "Get Started" button to begin using the note taker. After the button is clicked, there will be 2 text field labeled "Note Title" and "Note Text". When the user clicks the fields, they will be able to type into it. After both fields are filled, a save icon will appear in th eupper right corner where they will be able to save their note. The saved note will be moved over to the left hand side which can be viewed again if clicked on. If the user no longer needs the note, there will be a delete button to the right of the saved note that can be pressed to delete that note. 

    (I did modify the index.js file a bit so that the user can also edit their saved note.)

## Installation:
To run this application, the following installs will be required:

        * Node.js
